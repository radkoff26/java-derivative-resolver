# Java Derivative Resolver
This is a project which represents a derivative resolver.

It can actually find derivatives from string as expressions. This project also provides converter to LaTeX format which can be useful
for quick calculation of derivative of some expression and conversion it to the format which is frequently used for 
mathematical expressions.

Nevertheless, this project is not performing complete simplification yet. This is a task for the future.
